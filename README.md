# Python Basic Projects

This repository contains my initial Python projects focused on learning and practicing core programming concepts. These projects are intentionally simple and are built to strengthen fundamentals before moving on to larger and more complex applications.

This repository will grow over time as I improve my skills and add more advanced projects.
